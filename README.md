# GEGL_Extract_and_Color_Luminance_Channel
GEGL Extracts the brightness channel from an image and colorizes and blurs it. This filter was inspired by Gimp/GEGL's "Bloom" and Pixelitor's "Extract channel" filter. It shows that GEGL has the ability to extract channels for non-destructive editing with blend modes.
